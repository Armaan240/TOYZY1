**26 JUNE 2025 (idea and Research and Development)**

**(4PM-6PM)**

This is the day when TOYZY1 was just an idea , did many research and decided to create a 3D printer which will be of Cartesian type , and Learned about how to create an its 3D model ,Also decided it will work on Ardiuno Mega And Make the BOM of all parts required tillthe date

Here's a **clean Bill of Materials (BOM)** for the TOYZY 3D Printer, organized by system:

**(10PM-12PM)**
Understanded All Movments included in The 3D Printer And Created Moving Y AXIS and Bed IN Model ,Spent 1 Hour only For Understanding from Articles and Youtube Videos About 3D Printers

**Total Time of The Day** :- 5 Hours


**27 JUNE 2025 (Restructured The Y axis In the Model and Created Detailed Parts)**

**(12PM-5PM)**
Today's day was Very Hatic As I learned more About Fusion And Tried to Change and restructre the whole movement and placement of motor and belts and rods i tried to make it as detailed as possible and also added a grip and stand for whole structure , removed the bottom and made more realistic look of bedand motors spent hoursand hours on reading arctilces about fusion softwares ,viewd few toutorials and still need more practice but i happy from todays work ,created every single part and assembled in the structure and now i am feeling it the cute TOYZY is becoming a beast , Only Placements of Xand Z axis Is Left For Whole Mechanical Structure To Complete Then Work ON Circuit And Electronics Part Here Some Images Of Todays work
