## **26 JUNE 2025 (Idea and Research and Development)**

### **(4PM-6PM)**

The day when TOYZY1 was just a thought , did many research and decided to create a 3D printer which will be of Cartesian type , and Learned about how to create its 3D model , Also decided it will work on Ardiuno Mega and Ramp shield ,the Idea of the 3D printer is not just one day thought it was in bucket list from past 2 years but was not able to get started ,and was left written in dairy ,and the dairy was misplaced, but what a coincidence when i just filled the submission form
and was thinking what to make for the program and suddenlt my says your old diary got found under the sttorage box ,and i got excited and at that time i was feeling notalgic , thus got to that page where my dream project was written TOYZY a 3d printer ,so that was the story behind building this project and i know most of the person would think it is created story but beilve me i it is a true Incident. 

### **(6PM-7PM)**

**Created A Basic Structure In Fusion And Started The 3D Modeling Journey**

### **(10PM-12AM)**
Grokked All Movments included in The 3D Printer And Created Movable Bed in y-axis direction , Spent 1 Hour For grasping the concepts from online articles and Youtube Videos About 3D Printers And Created A simple Structure for Reference and Would UpGrade it in Future.i know the modelisnot looking good for now as it my first time creating a 3D model in Fusion , i have decided to learn more about it tommorow.

**Total Time of The Day** :- 5 Hours


## **27 JUNE 2025 (Restructured The Y axis In the Model and Created Detailed Parts)**

### **(12PM-3PM)**
Today's day was Very Hatic As per the plans I learned more About Fusion Because Yesterday's work was more focused on Understanding things and Forgot the cricial Part of 3D Model and the Project (TO ACHIEVE PERFECTION) And Tried to Change and restructre the whole movement and placement of motor and belts and rods I tried to make it as detailed as possible and also added a grip and stand for whole structure , removed the bottom and made more realistic look of Step motors spent hours and hours on reading articles about fusion softwares ,viewd few tutorials and still need more practice but i'm happy from today's work ,created every single part and assembled in the structure and now i am feeling it the cute TOYZY is becoming a beast , Only Placements of X and Z axis Is Left For Whole Mechanical Structure To Complete Then Work on Circuit And Electronics Part  ,Here's Some Images Of Today's work

**Total Time of The Day** :- 3 Hours

## **28 JUNE 2025 (Built The Z axis from Scratch)**
 
### **(10AM-12PM)**

This is My first time building a complex project so i wanted it to give my 100% to make it good look and perfect in the practical life also studied about how i can make stable and good Z axis which could hold the weight of Two motors , so i deicded to build it with 20x20 in model too so that it would also add a realistic feel to the model attached lead screws to step motors but with dual smooth rods that could provide smoothness in working and also a good foundation as well as control to the X Axis ...Here are some pis of what i built so far

**Total Time of The Day** :- 2 Hours

## **29 JUNE 2025 (Built The X axis from Scratch,Added Hot End And Extruder,Worked On Small Details)**

### **(9AM-10:30AM)**
As last two days were not productive as i planned, due to fever but today i was working only for mission to complete the important parts , first created the mounts for X axis and smooth rods also it could hold the motors so after many rejection of design finally created Perfect mount which could all required things , then created the cap of rods and screw this would provide more stablity to the Whole structure also ,
Here's the pic of the mount and Cap attached.

### **(4PM-8PM)**
The X Axis Mount for Extruder and HotEnd was Left so i created it first and Tried to Make The Main Printing Part From Scratch And the Main challenge i faced was Design of the Hot end So by some creativity and Lots of HardWork Finally Buit See what i have made (SORRY FOR BLURED PHOTO AS IT WAS TAKEN FROM PHONE INSTEAD OF A SCREENSHOT)

Next i added some more details like the belt which would move The X Axis and The Attached Timing Pully At Step motors ,the belt part was really time consuming
also after suggestion from one of my friend i Change the Colour Of the Logo and And Whole Model To Red And Black
**So Here Are the Images of all Mechanical Part ,Next We Will Move to Electronic (controllers,Touch Screen,Hot Bed etc)**

**Total Time of The Day** :- 5 Hours 30 Minutes

## **30 JUNE 2025 (Completed The Electronis Part and made Changes in THe Model ,Finished Everything)**

### **(3PM-8PM)**
Today I it in of my system only with to level motivation of speedrunning every single thing but with most of my potenial and consciousness to make everything look good
# Electronics
Now i was at that point where all working of Toyzy depends ,the electronics part firt as i already have some knowledge about Ardiuno so choose it as the main controller but as the project is complex so idecided to see some advance tourtorials about ardiuno and Ramp Shield and Motor driver and after a hour Grokking everthing started creating the circuit at my own as now i have full confidence of what i learned.
so starting with the Motors i connected the and Yaxis motor to the motorpins and then connected two X axis motorin parrallel and then connected to the board next connected Two Z axis Motors to the Board
then connected Hot bed and Extruter Thermistors,Then 2 fans With power supply and and 1 for Heatsink ,moving to lcd display i choose a 3.5 inch tft touch diplay a connceted to the EXp1 And Exp2 the connected hotend and  heat bed to th board ,
as There were many thing connected to a single board so the wiring looks very complex but trust me i have assinged diff color to diff wires so try to zoom the pic for more understanding ,tried to make it more cleaner but coudnt
i will be using Marlin As Firmware and Will try to create my custom and personalised one in future

# Final Touches
after completion of the circuit part i made some required and final changes to the 3D model , Created And compartment for The Power Supply and And the the controller and attached the touch display in front i have created a trasparent covering also to go with the trend and also to keep check of everything going well thus justify its term (transparency) also Added My logo on Top And did some changes by making the colort of letter "O" to black in order to match my theme and also attached the belt to y axis,
**Trust me Every Single Component Is in This Model is handcreated from Scratch except the Some Of them Were made by own creativity and very little of them were created by taking just references from the one available on the Internet and were Customized as per my needs(with word customization i did not mean just changing the colour) Only One of them The the Ramp Shield Was Taken From Net as its very complex structure at its own(it Was not Copy Pasted i did many changes also)**
And now just Ceating it INRL is Left to actually create things in real

**Total Time of The Day** :- 5 Hours

## **5th July 2025**

### **(4PM-6PM)**
Today did a small work but most importent (getting reviews) i took reviews from the Discord server about my 3d printer the reviews were mixed type but main highlited ones for the design which is good and the customized toolhead of the printer but some of them were asking me to remove an smooth rodon z axis but also advised me to keep the extra rod,so that i can remove it as per my requirement when will be building the printer so i can understand which rod to be removed.

**Total Time of The Day** :- 2 hours

## **6th July 2025**

### **(8AM-9AM)**
Today i got a reply from the the reviewer on 7:22am IST ,that he need a F3d file of the whole model ,first iwas confused because it was already uploaded in the some BigGuys Zip file but got to know it was not in the correct format so i went up to the fusion and open my filed i got know the changes i made yesterday were not saved , so i quickly speedrun the changes and fixed the issuses and akso added belt tension makers at botom of the bed and behind the tool head ,these are for reprstation and may need to change as i will make it manually with Plastic.

### **(5PM-7PM)**
Added Extruder And editted the Toolhead With Extruder Created A REnder Model for more realtsictness and polished some points on WHole Thing
