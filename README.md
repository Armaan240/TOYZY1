# TOYZY
TOYZY isn‚Äôt just a 3D printer. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve dreamt of building from the ground up ‚Äî a project that started as a wild idea and slowly turned into reality, piece by piece. I didn‚Äôt buy kits, I didn‚Äôt clone someone else‚Äôs design. I wanted to make my own version, fully custom ‚Äî with a goal to actually understand every nut, bolt, wire, and line of code that goes into making a 3D printer tick.

The frame is made of aluminum extrusions, connected by joints I modeled and plan to 3D print myself. Inside, it runs on an Arduino Mega and RAMPS board, with a touchscreen display, (NFC potential, and Wi-Fi modules coming soon). It‚Äôll feature a dual Z-motor system for extra stability and a compact, custom-designed extruder I call the TOYZY head, with three fans, sleek aesthetics, and serious performance. I designed every inch of the printer in Fusion 360, from the frame down to the cable mounts.

## Why I Created It
I‚Äôve always been fascinated with machines that create ‚Äî CNCs, plotters, robots, 3D printers. But 3D printing stuck with me. I‚Äôve seen people buy off-the-shelf machines and never really learn how they work. I didn‚Äôt want that. I wanted to build the machine, not just use it.

It became more than just a printer. It became a challenge to myself: Can I really build something this complex from nothing? Can I figure out the mechanical parts, the electronics, and even the firmware? Can I make it look cool and functional ‚Äî not just work, but feel like mine?

## The Bucket List Moment
This whole project actually came from a random "bucket list" I wrote for myself one night. I was just thinking about all the things I want to do before I'm too busy to take on big ideas. One of the things on that list was ‚ÄúBuild a full 3D printer from scratch.‚Äù No pre-made kits, no shortcuts. Just me, my laptop, a soldering iron, and way too many late nights.

I didn‚Äôt expect to actually start this so soon ‚Äî but once I began designing the frame in Tinkercad (and quickly realized its limits), I downloaded Fusion 360 and went all in. From there, it became an obsession. Every part I model or assemble is me crossing off one more item from that list.
