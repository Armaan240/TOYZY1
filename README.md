# TOYZY
TOYZY is not just a 3D printer. Its the thing dream of building from the ground up this the  project that started only as idea and slowly turned into reality I did not buy kits, I didnâ€™t clone someone elseâ€™s design. I wanted to make my own version, fully custom â€” with a goal to actually understand every nut, bolt, wire, and every line of code that goes into making a 3D printer tick.

The frame is made of aluminum extrusions connected by joints internally so that dont look ugly I modeled and plan to 3D print myself. Inside it runs on an Arduino Mega and RAMPS board with a touchscreen display, (NFC potential and Wi-Fi modules coming soon). Itâ€™ll feature a dual Z-motor system for extra stability and acreated compact custom-designed extruder I call it the TOYZY head with three fans, sleek aesthetics, and serious performance. I designed every inch of the printer in Fusion 360 from the frame down to the cable mounts. 
**Also Please Ignore the missing part in The third Image It may Due to a Techincal Glitch And the Aluminium Extrunction going inside the Stands actually Stands will be engraved and modfied as per requirement**

## Why I Created It
I have always been thinking of a machines that create â€” CNCs, plotters, robots, 3D printers. But 3D printing stuck with me. Iâ€™ve seen people buy off-the-shelf machines and never really learn how they work. I did not wanted that. I wanted to build the machine not to just use it. so that come across the experience many people do lag behind

For me it is more than just a printer It has became a challenge to myself that can I really build something this complex from nothing or can I figure out the mechanical parts the electronics and even the firmware can I make it look cool and functional but not only just work and also feel like mine

## The Bucket List Moment
This whole project actually came from a random "bucket list" I wrote for myself one night 2 years ago. I was just thinking about all the things I wanted to do before but never had a will to take on big ideas. One of the things on that list was â€œBuild a full 3D printer from scratch." and coincedencly my mom found the diary in which i wrote to my future self to build a 3D printer

I didnâ€™t expect to actually start this so soon â€” but once I began designing the frame in Tinkercad (and quickly realized its limits), I downloaded Fusion 360 and went all in. From there it became an obsession. Every part I model or assemble is me crossing off one more item from that list.
